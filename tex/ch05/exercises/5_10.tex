% Exercise 5.10

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] \verb|["hello",42]| is not a valid expression, since it
    attempts to construct a list from elements of two different types,
    \verb|String| and |Int|.
    \item[(b)] \verb|['h',"ello"]| is not a valid expression, since it
    attempts to construct a list from elements of two different types,
    \verb|Char| and |String|.
    \item[(c)] \verb|['a','b','c']| is a valid expression.
    \item[(d)] \verb|length ['w','h','o']| is a valid expression.
    \item[(e)] \verb|length "hello"| is a valid expression.
    \item[(f)] \verb|reverse| is a valid expression, even though GHCI cannot
    print it.
\end{itemize}
