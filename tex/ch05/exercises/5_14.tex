% Exercise 5.14

We have the definitions of these functions in \path{src/Ch05/Exponential.hs}.

In order to calculate how big $n$ needs to be to get within 1 percent of the correct 
value for $x = 1$, we have the following:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> calcMinExpErr 1 1 0.01
134
\end{verbatim}
To calculate how big $n$ needs to be to get within 1 percent of the correct value for
$x = 10$, we have:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> calcMinExpErr 1 10 0.01
\end{verbatim}
This does not return a value within 10 minutes.
