% Exercise 5.14

We have the following set of functions in \path{src/ch05/exponential.hs}:
\begin{verbatim}
type R = Double

expList :: R -> [R]
expList x = [(1.0 + x / n) ** n | n <- [1 ..]]

expErr :: R -> R -> R
expErr x approx = abs (exp x - approx)

listExpErr :: [R] -> R -> [R]
listExpErr es x = [expErr x e | e <- es]

withinTolerance :: [R] -> R -> Bool
withinTolerance xs eps = last xs < eps

calcMinExpErr :: Int -> R -> R -> Int
calcMinExpErr n x eps =
  if withinTolerance (take n (listExpErr (expList x) x)) eps
    then n
    else calcMinExpErr (n + 1) x eps
\end{verbatim}
In order to calculate how big $n$ needs to be to get within 1 percent of the correct 
value for $x = 1$, we have the following:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> calcMinExpErr 1 1 0.01
135
\end{verbatim}
To calculate how big $n$ needs to be to get within 1 percent of the correct value for
$x = 10$, we have:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> calcMinExpErr 1 10 0.01
\end{verbatim}
This does not return a value within 10 minutes.
