% Exercise 5.15

For this question, we update the code in \path{src/Ch05/Exponential.hs} to allow us
to pass in a different approximation function, in this case the function \verb|expSeries|
and calculate the result. Thus we have
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
type R = Double

expList :: R -> [R]
expList x = [(1.0 + x / n) ** n | n <- [1 ..]]

expSeries :: R -> [R]
expSeries x = [(x ** n) / product [1 .. n] | n <- [1 ..]]

expErr :: R -> R -> R
expErr x approx = abs (exp x - approx)

calcMinExpErr :: Int -> R -> R -> (R -> [R]) -> Int
calcMinExpErr n x eps approx =
  if expErr x (approx x !! n) < eps
    then n
    else calcMinExpErr (n + 1) x eps approx
s approx
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
However, this does not return a result even for $x = 1$ within any reasonable time frame,
so these functions must be optimized to produce a result more quickly.
