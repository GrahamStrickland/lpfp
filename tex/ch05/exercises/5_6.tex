% Exercise 5.6

We have the function \verb|last'| with the following definition
\begin{verbatim}
import GHC.Stack (HasCallStack)

last' :: HasCallStack => [a] -> a 
last' x = head (reverse x)
\end{verbatim}
\verb|last'| returns the last item in an argument with type that implements 
\verb|HasCallStack|, an error if the argument is empty, or hangs indefinitely
if the variable has infinite length.\par
\qquad We demonstrate as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> last' [1, 2, 3]
3
ghci> last' ["check", "mate"]
"mate"
ghci> last' []
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list
