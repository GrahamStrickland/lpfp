% Exercise 5.12

We have the following expression 
\begin{verbatim}
series :: Double
series = sum [1.0 / n | n <- [1..100]]
\end{verbatim}
used to calculate
\[
    \sum_{n=1}^{100} \frac{1}{n^2}.
\]
Evaluating this in \verb|ghci| results in the following:
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> series
5.187377517639621
\end{verbatim}
