% Exercise 5.11

It seems as if an arithmetic sequence will end at the last 
integer in the sequence before the last element in the constructor if the 
sequence is an integer sequence.\par
\qquad If it is a floating point sequence, i.e., one of the elements in the 
constructor was of floating point type, then the last number in the sequence 
will be the number in the sequence occurring after the last element in the 
constructor if that last element is further than the midpoint between two 
elements in the sequence, otherwise it will be the number occurring before.\par
We demonstrate as follows:
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
ghci> [0,3..7.5]
[0.0,3.0,6.0,9.0]
ghci> [0,3..7.49]
[0.0,3.0,6.0]
ghci> [0,3..7.499999999]
[0.0,3.0,6.0]
ghci> [0,3..7]
[0,3,6]
ghci> [0,3..8]
[0,3,6]
ghci> [0,3..9]
[0,3,6,9]
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
