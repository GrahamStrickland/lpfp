% Exercise 6.7

The function \verb|replicate| has the following definition
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
ghci> :t replicate
replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
which indicates that it takes an input of type \verb|Int| and an input of type 
\verb|a| and produces a list of type \verb|[a]|. The first three examples use
types that are concatenated into lists. The fourth example uses the value
\verb|'x'| of type \verb|Char|, which when concatenated together 3 times produces
a list of \verb|Char| which is simplified to the equivalent \verb|String|, since
a \verb|String| is a list of \verb|Char|.
