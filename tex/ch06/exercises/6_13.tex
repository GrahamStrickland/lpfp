% Exercise 6.13

We have the following definition in the file \path{src/Ch06/Filter.hs}
\begin{verbatim}
filter' :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter' predicate as = [a | a <- as, predicate a]
\end{verbatim}
which we test using
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> filter' (\n -> n < 10) [6,4,8,13,7]
[6,4,8,7]
\end{verbatim}
