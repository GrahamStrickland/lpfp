% Exercise 6.3

We have the following
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> :t map
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
ghci> :t not
not :: Bool -> Bool
ghci> :t map not
map not :: [Bool] -> [Bool]
\end{verbatim}
where \verb|not| substitutes the type \verb|Bool| for \verb|a| and \verb|b| in the 
definition of \verb|map|, so that \verb|map not| has the type \verb|[Bool] -> [Bool]|.
