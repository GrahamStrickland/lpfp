% Exercise 8.2

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Two functions $f$ and $g$ are equal if and only if they have
        the same domain and range, and for every element of the domain, they
        map to the same element of the range, i.e., if $f: X \to Y$ and $g: X \to Y$,
        then
        \begin{equation*}
            \begin{split}
                f &= g \\
                \Leftrightarrow f(x) &= g(x) \forall x \in X. \\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation*}
    \item[(b)] The computer cannot necessarily compute each element of the domain
        in a reasonable time to ensure that both functions map each element of the 
        domain to the same element in the range.
    \item[(c)] 
        \begin{verbatim}
           f :: Bool a => a -> a 
        \end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
