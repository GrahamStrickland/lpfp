% Exercise 9.4

We have the following definition in \path{src/Ch09/MaybeToList.hs}
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
maybeToList :: Maybe a -> [a]
maybeToList x = case x of
    Just y -> [y]
    Nothing -> []
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
which we test using
\scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
ghci> maybeToList (Just 1)
[1]
ghci> maybeToList Nothing
[]
\end{verbatim}\normalsize
We map the empty list to represent \verb|Nothing| and map \verb|Just x| to a list 
of one element.
