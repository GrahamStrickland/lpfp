% Exercise 9.3

We have the following definition in \path{src/Ch09/SafeHead.hs}
\begin{verbatim}
headSafe :: [a] -> Maybe a
headSafe ys = case ys of
    [] -> Nothing
    (x : _) -> Just x
\end{verbatim}
which we test using
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> headSafe []
Nothing
ghci> headSafe [1]
Just 1
ghci> headSafe [1,2]
Just 1
ghci> headSafe [1,2,3]
Just 1
\end{verbatim}
