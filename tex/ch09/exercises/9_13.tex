% Exercise 9.13

We have the following definition from \path{src/Ch09/Pick13.hs}:
\begin{verbatim}
pick13' :: [(R,R,R)] -> [(R,R)]
pick13' triples = [(x_1,x_3) | (x_1,_,x_3) <- triples]
\end{verbatim}
which we demonstrate as follows
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> pick13 [(1,2,3),(2,4,6)]
[(1.0,3.0),(2.0,6.0)]
ghci> pick13' [(1,2,3),(2,4,6)]
[(1.0,3.0),(2.0,6.0)]
\end{verbatim}
