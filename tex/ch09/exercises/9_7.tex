% Exercise 9.7

No, for instance, we have the following error when trying to convert a list
of empty tuples (the list containing the unit type):
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> (zip' . unzip) [()]

<interactive>:10:17: error:
    • Couldn't match expected type ‘(a, b)’ with actual type ‘()’
    • In the expression: ()
      In the first argument of ‘zip' . unzip’, namely ‘[()]’
      In the expression: (zip' . unzip) [()]
    • Relevant bindings include
        it :: [(a, b)] (bound at <interactive>:10:1)
\end{verbatim}

Yes, since this does return exactly the expression it was passed in, e.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
ghci> (unzip . zip') ([], [])
([],[])
ghci> (unzip . zip') ([1,2,3], ["Albert","Isaac","James"])
([1,2,3],["Albert","Isaac","James"])
\end{verbatim}
