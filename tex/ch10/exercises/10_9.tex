% Exercise 10.9

Using the definition in the file \path{src/Ch10/BallSpeed.hs}, we have the plot in 
Figure~\ref{fig10_9}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, center]{../plots/10_9.pdf}
    \caption{Plot of rate of change of the speed of the ball as a function of time
        \label{fig10_9}} 
\end{figure}

From this plot, we can tell that the rate of change of its speed is equal when it
reachs time $t = 4$s. At this point its acceleration is, by definition $a = 0$, 
while its velocity is given by $v \approx 61.56745393019432$.
